====================================================================

UNO is a fast-paced card game where you race against the CPU to be
the first player to get rid of all your cards! Use strategy, quick
thinking, and action cards to win.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                           HOW TO PLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. STARTING THE GAME
   - Each player (you and the CPU) starts with 7 cards.
   - A card from the deck is placed face-up to start the discard pile.

2. YOUR TURN
   - Match the top card on the discard pile by color or number/symbol.
   - If you don't have a match, press [D] to draw a card.
   - If the drawn card can be played, press [T] to throw it.

3. SPECIAL CARDS
   - Skip   : CPU loses its next turn.
   - Reverse: Reverses turn order (acts as Skip in 2-player mode).
   - Draw 2 : CPU draws 2 cards and skips a turn.
   - Wild   : Change the current color to any color.
   - +4 Wild: Change color and make CPU draw 4 cards.

4. DECLARING UNO
   - When you have only ONE card left, press [U] to declare UNO!
   - Forget to declare? Draw 2 penalty cards!

5. WINNING THE GAME
   - First player to get rid of all cards wins.
   - If the CPU empties its hand first, you lose.
